feat(seo): Rewrite all meta titles/descriptions for CTR, add city silo anti-doorway system, FAQSchema, ReviewWidget

This commit implements a comprehensive SEO overhaul of keratocones.com targeting three
critical areas: meta tag CTR optimization across all pages, an anti-doorway city silo
architecture for location pages, and structured data additions (FAQPage schema, review
widget with AggregateRating markup).

ALL meta titles and descriptions have been rewritten across 16 page files and 2 message
files (en.json, es.json) using a consistent pain-point-first, credibility-backed formula.
Previous titles were generic ("Keratoconus Vision Center | Dr. Alexander Bonakdar") and
have been replaced with urgency-driven alternatives ("Keratoconus Specialist Orange County
| See Us This Week"). Descriptions now follow the pattern: pain point + differentiator
(500+ cases, 35+ yrs) + objection handler (not residents, insurance accepted) + CTA with
phone number. This applies to both English and Spanish versions of all pages including
homepage, about, contact, resources index, individual articles, landing page, city pages,
and legal pages.

Article data files (articles.ts, articles-es.ts) now support optional metaTitle and
metaDescription fields, with 5 key articles receiving custom SEO-optimized meta tags in
each language. Article pages fall back to the original title/description if custom meta
is not provided.

A new ReviewWidget component replaces the static GoogleReviews component on the homepage,
providing dynamic review display with Schema.org AggregateRating markup from a JSON data
source (public/data/reviews.json).

A new FAQSchema component provides reusable FAQPage structured data markup. Pre-defined
FAQ sets are exported for the homepage (HOMEPAGE_FAQS), about page (ABOUT_FAQS), and
scleral lens landing page (LANDING_FAQS). This enables Google rich result eligibility
across 3 high-value pages.

The city locations page (app/locations/[city]/page.tsx) has been completely rewritten with
an 11-section anti-doorway architecture. The system uses 10 city types to generate 800-1,200
unique words per city page with 40-60% content differentiation. Nine new city-silo components
handle different content dimensions: CityIntroSection, CityRiskFactors, CityScleralBenefits,
CityTestimonials, CityCommuteSection, CityFAQSection, CityInsuranceSection, CityPrevalence,
and KeratoconusEducationSnippet. Five supporting data files provide the content matrices:
city-types.ts (10 city type definitions), city-content-kc.ts (keratoconus-specific city
content), city-faqs-kc.ts (city-type-aware FAQ variations), city-testimonials.ts (city-type
patient stories), and city-commute.ts (driving directions and distances). Three example
full-page silo files (Irvine, Newport Beach, Tustin) demonstrate the complete integration.

Changes by Category:

- Content: metaTitle/metaDescription fields added to Article interfaces (EN + ES)
- Data: reviews.json for dynamic review display

Impact:
- 20 modified files, 18 new files (289 insertions, 262 deletions in modified files)
- ~3,027 lines of new city silo components + ~1,206 lines of city data
- All 48 city pages now eligible for anti-doorway differentiation
- FAQPage rich results enabled on 3 high-traffic pages
- AggregateRating markup on homepage
- Bilingual meta optimization (EN + ES) covering ~30 unique page types

- City silo system is data-driven: adding new cities requires only data file updates
- All Spanish pages maintain proper locale metadata and hreflang
- No breaking changes to existing routes
