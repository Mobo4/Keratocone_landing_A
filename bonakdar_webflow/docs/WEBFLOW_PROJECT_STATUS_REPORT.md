## 🚨 TECHNICAL CHALLENGE ANALYSIS

### Primary Issue: Webflow API Authentication
**Problem**: Current API token `ws-41e6873251954daadfd90e2812d618e032e1c0101fe8e0f1c9b42db05c75eaf5` lacks required scopes

**API Test Result**:
```
Error: "OAuthForbidden: You are missing the following scopes - 'sites:read'"
Impact: Cannot proceed with automated MCP-based site creation
```

**Resolution Required**:
1. Regenerate Webflow API token with full permissions
2. Test all required API endpoints
3. Implement fallback manual approach if API issues persist

### Secondary Issues Identified:
1. **Scope Complexity**: Full 6-month implementation ambitious for initial consensus
2. **Risk Management**: Need enhanced rollback procedures
3. **Timeline Pressure**: Conservative approach required for stakeholder confidence

## 🔧 RESOLUTION STRATEGY IMPLEMENTED

### Hybrid Implementation Approach (RECOMMENDED)

#### Phase 1A: Manual Foundation (Days 1-2)
- **Manual Webflow site creation** via UI (eliminates API dependency)
- **Basic design system implementation** using documented color palette
- **Risk Level**: LOW (proven manual process)
- **Success Criteria**: Site accessible, design system functional

#### Phase 1B: API Integration (Days 3-5)
- **Resolve API token permissions** following detailed setup guide
- **Implement automated content management** once API validated
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM (with manual fallback ready)
- **Success Criteria**: API functionality verified, CMS collections created

4. **Maintain conservative approach** until full stakeholder confidence achieved

## 🔄 ADDRESSING AI CONSENSUS CONCERNS

### Implementation Complexity (Primary Concern)
**Expert Concern**: "Medium-high complexity rating suggests potential challenges"
**Resolution**: Hybrid manual+API approach reduces technical dependency
**Validation**: Manual process proven, API as enhancement not requirement

### Timeline Feasibility (Secondary Concern)
**Expert Concern**: "5-week timeline might be aggressive"
**Resolution**: Conservative 2-week foundation phase only
**Validation**: Reduced scope eliminates timeline pressure

### Resource Allocation (Tertiary Concern)
**Expert Concern**: "Resource allocation might fall short if issues arise"
**Resolution**: Manual fallbacks eliminate single points of failure
**Validation**: Multiple implementation paths ensure progress continuity
