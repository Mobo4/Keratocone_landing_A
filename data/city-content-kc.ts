    'coastal-affluent': `${cityName} residents living along Orange County's premier coastline understand the value of protecting their most important sense. The combination of intense ocean-reflected UV light, salt-laden winds, and an outdoor lifestyle that spans year-round surfing, sailing, and beachside dining creates a visual environment that demands peak performance from your eyes. For those diagnosed with keratoconus, the irregular corneal surface scatters light in ways that make coastal glare nearly unbearable without proper correction. Standard glasses and soft contacts cannot compensate for the cone-shaped distortion that keratoconus creates. Dr. Bonakdar has treated keratoconus patients from ${cityName} for over 35 years, understanding that your expectations for vision quality match the premium lifestyle you've built. Our scleral lens fittings account for the specific visual demands of coastal living—from reading yacht instruments to driving Pacific Coast Highway at sunset without debilitating halos.`,

    'coastal-active': `${cityName}'s identity is built on surf culture, beach volleyball courts, and an active outdoor lifestyle that makes Southern California famous. For keratoconus patients in this community, the condition strikes at the core of daily life. Irregular astigmatism from a cone-shaped cornea turns ocean glare into blinding starbursts, makes reading wave sets nearly impossible, and transforms every sunset drive into a gauntlet of halos and ghost images. Eye rubbing—one of the strongest risk factors for keratoconus progression—is especially prevalent among ${cityName} residents who deal with seasonal allergies, sand irritation, and salt-air dryness. Dr. Bonakdar's practice has become a destination for active patients from ${cityName} because we design scleral lens fits that stay stable during physical activity, resist debris, and provide the crisp, wide-field vision that surfers, cyclists, and runners need. Your keratoconus treatment should support your lifestyle, not limit it.`,

    'tech-university': `${cityName} sits at the intersection of innovation and education, home to tech campuses, research institutions, and a population that spends more hours in front of screens than almost any other demographic in Southern California. For keratoconus patients in this community, prolonged digital work amplifies every symptom the condition produces. The halos and ghosting that keratoconus causes around high-contrast text become exhausting after eight hours of coding, design work, or academic research. Fluctuating prescriptions—a hallmark of progressive keratoconus—mean that the glasses that worked last semester may be useless this quarter. Dr. Bonakdar sees a disproportionate number of patients from ${cityName} because keratoconus onset peaks during the university and early career years (ages 15-25), exactly when screen demands are highest. Our scleral lens protocols are optimized for sustained digital comfort, with customized optics that reduce the aberrations keratoconus creates at typical monitor distances.`,

    'family-suburban': `${cityName} is one of South Orange County's most family-focused communities, with top-ranked schools, youth soccer leagues, and a neighborhood culture built around raising children. This matters for keratoconus because the condition most commonly begins during adolescence—precisely when your child is building academic foundations and developing athletic skills. A teenager whose vision is quietly deteriorating from keratoconus may struggle with reading comprehension, avoid sports that require depth perception, or complain of headaches they cannot explain. Parents in ${cityName} often arrive at our practice after a school optometrist noticed unusual astigmatism that keeps changing, or after their child's soft contact lenses stopped providing clear vision. Dr. Bonakdar specializes in early keratoconus detection and pediatric scleral lens fitting, helping ${cityName} families intervene before the condition advances to stages that require surgical intervention.`,

    'affluent-residential': `${cityName} residents have built lives centered on quality—quality schools, quality homes, quality healthcare. When keratoconus enters the picture, settling for generic treatment from a general optometrist is not acceptable. This progressive corneal condition demands a specialist who has managed hundreds of cases, invested in advanced corneal mapping technology, and maintains relationships with the leading scleral lens laboratories in the country. Dr. Bonakdar has treated over 500 keratoconus patients, and many of our ${cityName} families found us after unsuccessful attempts with standard rigid gas-permeable lenses or ill-fitting scleral lenses from providers who fit them infrequently. The difference between a competent fit and an exceptional one is the difference between tolerating your lenses and forgetting you're wearing them. Our practice provides the meticulous, unhurried care that ${cityName} residents expect—because restoring your vision is not something that should be rushed.`,

    'urban-diverse': `${cityName} is one of Orange County's most vibrant and diverse communities, and this diversity extends to the demographics of keratoconus itself. Research consistently shows that keratoconus prevalence is significantly higher in Hispanic, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African American populations—communities that are well-represented in ${cityName}. Despite this elevated risk, many patients in these communities go undiagnosed for years because standard vision screenings miss the irregular astigmatism that keratoconus creates. By the time they reach a specialist, the condition has often progressed beyond what glasses can correct. Dr. Bonakdar has served the ${cityName} community for decades, with a bilingual staff that can communicate in Spanish and an approach to care that respects cultural differences while delivering world-class keratoconus treatment. We believe that access to a scleral lens specialist should not depend on your zip code or insurance type.`,

    'suburban-commuter': `For ${cityName} residents, daily life revolves around the freeway—commuting to work, driving children to school, and running errands across Orange County. Keratoconus attacks the very visual skills that safe driving demands. The condition creates halos around headlights, ghosting of road signs, and glare sensitivity that makes night driving dangerous. Many ${cityName} patients describe their breaking point as the moment they realized they could no longer safely drive after dark. Standard eyeglasses cannot correct the higher-order aberrations that a cone-shaped cornea produces, leaving commuters squinting through progressively worsening vision. Dr. Bonakdar's scleral lens fittings are designed to vault completely over the irregular cornea, creating a smooth optical surface that eliminates the halos, ghosting, and glare that make driving treacherous. ${cityName} patients routinely tell us that getting their scleral lenses was the moment they got their independence back.`,

    'inland-growing': `${cityName} is part of one of the fastest-growing regions in Southern California, yet specialty eye care has not kept pace with population growth. Keratoconus patients in the Inland Empire and surrounding areas often face a frustrating reality: their local optometrist can diagnose the condition but lacks the equipment and experience to manage it. Scleral lens fitting requires specialized corneal topographers, a large lens inventory for trial fitting, and—most critically—a clinician who has fitted hundreds of keratoconus eyes. Dr. Bonakdar's Santa Ana practice has become a regional destination for ${cityName} residents who recognize that the 30-60 minute drive is a worthwhile investment in their vision. We structure appointments to minimize your total trips, often combining comprehensive evaluation, corneal mapping, and initial lens fitting into a single extended visit so you spend less time on the road and more time seeing clearly.`,

    'north-county-sd': `${cityName} patients who travel to our Santa Ana practice for keratoconus care are making a deliberate choice: expertise over convenience. San Diego County has excellent ophthalmologists, but very few clinicians who focus specifically on scleral lens fitting for keratoconus—the skill that separates functional vision from truly clear vision. Dr. Bonakdar has treated over 500 keratoconus patients across 35+ years, and his fitting success rate reflects that volume of experience. For ${cityName} residents, we design a visit schedule that respects the distance: initial consultation, comprehensive topography, and trial lens fitting are consolidated into your first appointment whenever possible. Follow-up adjustments are scheduled strategically, and we offer telehealth check-ins between in-person visits to reduce unnecessary trips. The patients who come from ${cityName} tell us the same thing: once you experience the vision quality from a properly fitted scleral lens, the drive becomes a non-issue.`,

    'la-gateway': `${cityName} residents have access to the largest concentration of eye care providers in Southern California, yet many keratoconus patients from your area still travel to our Santa Ana practice. The reason is specialization. Los Angeles County ophthalmology practices are excellent at cataract surgery, LASIK, and general eye care, but keratoconus scleral lens fitting is a niche skill that requires dedicated equipment, specific training, and high case volume to master. Dr. Bonakdar's 35+ years and 500+ keratoconus cases represent a level of focused expertise that most multi-specialty practices cannot match. For ${cityName} patients, our location in central Orange County is often a shorter drive than navigating LA traffic to a Westside or Downtown specialist. We are directly accessible via the I-5, I-405, or SR-55 freeways, with free parking and appointment availability designed for working professionals.`,

// Environmental and demographic keratoconus risk factors specific to city type
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

export function getLocalRiskFactors(cityType: CityType, cityName: string): string {
  const risks: Record<CityType, string> = {
    'coastal-affluent': `${cityName}'s coastal environment introduces specific keratoconus risk factors. Chronic UV exposure from ocean-reflected sunlight may contribute to oxidative stress in corneal tissue, and research suggests UV damage weakens collagen cross-links in the cornea. The salt air and onshore winds common along the ${cityName} coast exacerbate eye surface irritation, triggering the eye rubbing reflex that is the single strongest modifiable risk factor for keratoconus progression. Allergic conjunctivitis from coastal pollen and marine allergens compounds this cycle. We counsel ${cityName} patients to use preservative-free artificial tears proactively, wear wraparound UV protection outdoors, and break the eye rubbing habit through allergy management—because every instance of vigorous eye rubbing physically damages the corneal collagen that keratoconus has already weakened.`,

    'coastal-active': `Active outdoor residents of ${cityName} face a combination of keratoconus risk factors that compound each other. Sand and wind cause mechanical irritation, leading to reflexive eye rubbing—the number one modifiable risk factor for corneal thinning. Surfers and beach athletes experience repeated salt-water exposure, which disrupts the tear film and triggers inflammatory cascades on the corneal surface. Seasonal allergies from coastal sage and pollen further drive the itch-rub cycle. UV exposure during long outdoor sessions may accelerate collagen degradation in an already-compromised cornea. For ${cityName} patients with keratoconus, we emphasize strict allergy control (prescription antihistamine drops, not over-the-counter), cold compress techniques as a substitute for rubbing, and UV-protective scleral lenses that shield the cornea during outdoor activities.`,

    'tech-university': `${cityName}'s screen-intensive culture creates a less obvious but clinically significant keratoconus risk profile. Prolonged digital device use reduces blink rate by 40-60%, causing tear film instability and surface irritation that leads to eye rubbing—the strongest behavioral risk factor for keratoconus progression. University students and young tech workers represent the exact demographic where keratoconus is most likely to progress rapidly (ages 15-30). Academic pressure, irregular sleep schedules, and high caffeine consumption compound ocular surface stress. Additionally, the genetic component of keratoconus is relevant in ${cityName}'s diverse population, where higher prevalence among certain ethnic groups means that family history screening is essential. We counsel ${cityName} patients on the 20-20-20 rule, prescribe targeted ocular surface therapy, and monitor corneal topography every 6 months during the high-risk progression years.`,

    'family-suburban': `For ${cityName} families, the primary keratoconus risk factor is age—the condition almost always manifests between ages 10 and 25, meaning your school-age children are in the highest-risk window. Vigorous eye rubbing, often triggered by seasonal allergies prevalent in inland Orange County, is the most damaging behavioral factor. Children involved in contact sports face additional risk from direct eye trauma, which can accelerate corneal weakening. Genetic predisposition plays a significant role: if either parent has keratoconus, each child has roughly a 1-in-10 chance of developing it. We recommend that ${cityName} families with any keratoconus history bring children in for corneal topography screening by age 10, before the condition has a chance to advance beyond mild irregular astigmatism.`,

    'affluent-residential': `${cityName} residents benefit from health awareness and proactive screening, but keratoconus still catches many families off guard. The condition progresses silently in its early stages—the first sign is often a prescription that keeps changing at every eye exam. Genetic factors are the primary driver: keratoconus runs in families, and the hereditary component is especially important to monitor when parents have a history of the condition, high astigmatism, or corneal thinning. Eye rubbing from allergies remains the top modifiable risk factor, even in well-controlled home environments. ${cityName}'s dry Santa Ana wind conditions can exacerbate ocular surface irritation seasonally. We encourage proactive corneal topography screening for all family members when one member is diagnosed.`,

    'urban-diverse': `Keratoconus prevalence data reveals important patterns for ${cityName}'s diverse community. Studies consistently show 2-4x higher prevalence in Hispanic, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and African American populations compared to Caucasian populations. In ${cityName}, these demographics represent a significant portion of residents, meaning keratoconus is statistically more common here than in many surrounding cities. Environmental factors compound genetic risk: urban air quality, allergen exposure from older housing stock, and higher rates of allergic eye disease all contribute to the itch-rub cycle that accelerates corneal thinning. Limited access to specialty eye care means many ${cityName} patients are diagnosed at more advanced stages. Early screening with corneal topography—available at our practice—can detect keratoconus before vision loss becomes severe.`,

    'suburban-commuter': `${cityName}'s commuter lifestyle introduces keratoconus-relevant factors that patients often overlook. Long hours in air-conditioned vehicles dry the ocular surface, increasing irritation and the urge to rub—the single most damaging habit for keratoconus patients. Seasonal Santa Ana winds carry allergens that exacerbate this cycle. Driving-related visual demands also reveal keratoconus symptoms earlier than many other activities: halos around headlights, ghosting of road signs, and poor contrast sensitivity in rain or dusk conditions are often the first complaints that bring ${cityName} patients to a specialist. Genetic factors remain the primary driver, and we recommend topography screening for all family members of diagnosed patients, particularly children approaching their teenage years.`,

    'inland-growing': `${cityName}'s Inland location means hotter, drier conditions that stress the ocular surface more intensely than coastal areas. Higher ambient temperatures and lower humidity increase tear evaporation, causing persistent surface irritation and reflexive eye rubbing—the primary behavioral accelerant of keratoconus. Dust and particulate matter from ongoing construction in this rapidly developing region further aggravate allergic eye disease. The younger median age of ${cityName}'s growing population means a larger proportion of residents are in the peak keratoconus progression window (ages 15-30). Limited local access to corneal specialists means many patients go years between diagnosis and appropriate treatment, allowing unnecessary progression. We strongly encourage ${cityName} residents with a keratoconus diagnosis to seek scleral lens evaluation sooner rather than later.`,

    'north-county-sd': `${cityName}'s mix of coastal and inland environments creates a varied keratoconus risk profile. Coastal residents face UV and wind exposure, while inland neighborhoods contend with heat, dry air, and allergen-heavy chaparral vegetation—all of which drive eye surface irritation and the reflexive rubbing that accelerates corneal thinning. San Diego County's diverse population includes demographic groups with elevated keratoconus prevalence, including Hispanic and Middle Eastern communities. One significant risk factor for ${cityName} patients is delayed specialist care: the distance to a dedicated keratoconus practice means some patients wait months between noticing vision changes and receiving proper corneal topography. This delay allows progression that could have been prevented with timely cross-linking referral.`,

    'la-gateway': `${cityName}'s position within the Los Angeles metro area exposes residents to environmental factors that compound keratoconus risk. Urban air quality in the LA basin consistently ranks among the worst in the nation, and particulate pollution triggers allergic and irritant responses on the ocular surface, driving the eye rubbing habit that accelerates corneal thinning. LA's diverse population includes significant Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and South Asian communities—demographics with 2-4x higher keratoconus prevalence. The fast-paced metro lifestyle also contributes: screen-heavy work, irregular sleep, and delayed healthcare visits allow keratoconus to progress further before diagnosis. ${cityName} patients benefit from our proactive screening approach, which uses corneal topography to detect subclinical keratoconus before it causes significant visual impairment.`,

// DIMENSION 3: Scleral Lens Benefits (150-200 words)
// Lifestyle-matched advantages of scleral lenses for keratoconus
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

export function getScleralBenefits(cityType: CityType, cityName: string): string {
  const benefits: Record<CityType, string> = {
    'coastal-affluent': `For ${cityName}'s coastal residents, scleral lenses address keratoconus challenges that standard contacts cannot touch. These large-diameter lenses vault entirely over the irregular cornea, creating a smooth optical surface filled with preservative-free saline that acts as a liquid bandage. The result is vision quality that approaches—and sometimes exceeds—what you had before keratoconus. For the coastal lifestyle, scleral lenses offer specific advantages: they are virtually impossible to dislodge during water activities (unlike small RGP lenses that pop out in the surf), they block UV radiation from reaching the compromised cornea, and they protect against wind-driven debris. The saline reservoir underneath the lens keeps the corneal surface hydrated even in dry, salty air. ${cityName} patients appreciate that our premium scleral lens materials include the highest oxygen-permeability polymers available, allowing all-day wear from morning surf check to evening dinner without compromising corneal health. Dr. Bonakdar custom-designs each lens using high-resolution topography to match your unique corneal shape.`,

    'coastal-active': `Scleral lenses transform life for active ${cityName} residents with keratoconus. Unlike smaller rigid lenses that shift, rotate, or eject during physical activity, scleral lenses rest on the sclera (the white of the eye) and create a stable optical chamber that stays put during surfing, running, beach volleyball, and cycling. The lens vaults completely over the irregular cone, replacing the distorted corneal surface with a perfectly smooth optical front—eliminating the ghosting, halos, and streaking that make outdoor sports miserable with keratoconus. The saline reservoir trapped between lens and cornea provides continuous hydration, solving the dryness that wind and salt air cause. For ${cityName} athletes, we optimize lens edge profiles to resist wind-driven sand and design the overall fit for maximum stability during high-impact movement. Many patients tell us their scleral lenses gave them back activities they had given up, because for the first time since their diagnosis, they could see clearly and confidently during every outdoor pursuit.`,

    'tech-university': `For ${cityName}'s digital professionals and students, scleral lenses solve the specific keratoconus problems that make screen work grueling. The smooth optical surface of a properly fitted scleral lens eliminates the higher-order aberrations (coma, trefoil) that cause text ghosting, halos around bright UI elements, and the general visual noise that makes reading code or writing papers exhausting. The saline reservoir behind the lens acts as a continuous hydration system, countering the reduced blink rate that screen use causes—meaning your eyes stay comfortable through a full workday instead of drying out by afternoon. Dr. Bonakdar optimizes scleral lens prescriptions for typical monitor distances (20-26 inches), ensuring the optical correction is sharpest where ${cityName} patients need it most. Unlike glasses, scleral lenses eliminate edge distortion in peripheral vision and work seamlessly with ergonomic multi-monitor setups. Many of our tech-sector patients from ${cityName} report that their productivity returned to pre-keratoconus levels after switching to scleral lenses.`,

    'family-suburban': `For ${cityName} families dealing with a child's keratoconus diagnosis, scleral lenses provide a solution that addresses parents' top concerns: safety, durability, and visual clarity during school and sports. Scleral lenses are significantly larger than standard contacts, which makes them easier for teenagers to handle and virtually impossible to lose during physical activity—a real advantage for ${cityName} athletes playing soccer, basketball, or baseball. The lenses vault over the entire cornea without touching the cone, providing vision correction that glasses and soft contacts cannot achieve. For school performance, the difference is dramatic: text sharpens, whiteboards become readable from any seat, and the headaches that accompany uncorrected keratoconus often disappear entirely. Dr. Bonakdar has extensive experience fitting scleral lenses on younger patients, using age-appropriate lens sizes and teaching insertion and removal techniques that build confidence. ${cityName} parents appreciate our patient approach and the clear improvement they see in their child's academic engagement and athletic confidence.`,

    'affluent-residential': `${cityName} residents expect the highest standard in every aspect of their healthcare, and Dr. Bonakdar's scleral lens program delivers exactly that. Each lens is custom-designed using corneal topography data that maps your unique irregular surface with micron-level precision. The lens is manufactured to vault over the cone-shaped cornea, creating a new optical front surface that corrects not just the basic prescription but also the higher-order aberrations (coma, trefoil, spherical aberration) that make keratoconus vision so frustrating. We use premium lens materials with the highest available oxygen transmissibility, ensuring corneal health during all-day wear. The fitting process is meticulous: we evaluate multiple trial lenses, assess vault clearance with optical coherence tomography, and refine the design until the fit is truly optimized—not just acceptable. ${cityName} patients appreciate that we do not rush this process. A properly fitted scleral lens should feel comfortable within minutes, provide vision approaching 20/20, and last 1-2 years before replacement is needed.`,

    'urban-diverse': `Scleral lenses represent a turning point for keratoconus patients in ${cityName} who have struggled with inadequate vision correction. Many patients arrive at our practice having been told that glasses are "good enough" or that they simply need to tolerate blurry vision. Scleral lenses prove otherwise. By vaulting over the irregular cornea and creating a smooth optical surface, they provide the clearest vision possible without surgery—often restoring 20/25 or better acuity in eyes that tested 20/60 or worse with glasses. For ${cityName}'s working adults, this means being able to drive safely, read without strain, and perform job duties that require sharp vision. Scleral lenses are also more comfortable than smaller rigid lenses because they rest on the less-sensitive sclera, not the cornea. Dr. Bonakdar works with each ${cityName} patient's insurance situation and offers financing options to ensure that a keratoconus diagnosis does not mean a lifetime of compromised vision due to cost barriers.`,

    'suburban-commuter': `For ${cityName} commuters, scleral lenses solve the most dangerous aspect of keratoconus: impaired driving vision. The irregular cornea creates halos around every headlight and streetlight, ghosts every road sign, and destroys contrast sensitivity in rain or fog. Standard eyeglasses cannot correct these higher-order aberrations—but scleral lenses can. By creating a perfectly smooth optical surface over the distorted cornea, scleral lenses eliminate the optical chaos that makes night driving terrifying. ${cityName} patients consistently describe the moment they first drove at night with scleral lenses as transformative. The lenses also provide stable vision throughout the day, unlike some rigid lenses that shift during blinking and cause intermittent blurring. For commuters who spend 1-2 hours daily behind the wheel, this stability is not a luxury—it is a safety requirement. Dr. Bonakdar designs each lens to optimize distance vision acuity and contrast sensitivity, the two visual functions most critical for safe freeway driving.`,

    'inland-growing': `Scleral lenses are particularly valuable for ${cityName} keratoconus patients because they deliver the best possible vision correction while requiring fewer office visits than alternatives. Unlike smaller rigid gas-permeable lenses that need frequent adjustments due to corneal changes, a well-designed scleral lens maintains its fit longer because it rests on the stable sclera rather than the changing cone. This means fewer trips from ${cityName} to our Santa Ana office. The lens itself vaults completely over the irregular cornea, filling the space with saline that hydrates and protects—especially beneficial in the hotter, drier Inland climate. Vision quality is typically superior to any other non-surgical option: most patients achieve 20/25 or better, compared to 20/40 or worse with glasses. For ${cityName} residents who have limited local access to scleral lens expertise, our practice provides the specialized fitting technology and case experience needed to get the fit right the first time, minimizing the total number of visits required.`,

    'north-county-sd': `For ${cityName} patients willing to travel for the right specialist, scleral lenses justify the trip with vision results that are unmatched by other keratoconus correction methods. These custom-designed lenses create a new optical surface over the distorted cornea, typically restoring vision to 20/25 or better—a dramatic improvement for patients accustomed to 20/50+ acuity with glasses. The fitting process requires specialized corneal topography equipment that Dr. Bonakdar has invested in specifically for complex corneal cases. Once optimized, scleral lenses provide stable, comfortable vision for 12-16 hours daily, meaning ${cityName} patients can drive to our Santa Ana practice, have their follow-up appointment, and drive home with clear vision the entire time. We design our visit schedule for distance patients: first appointment combines evaluation, mapping, and trial fitting. Subsequent visits are spaced to align with your comfort traveling, and we offer telehealth check-ins to address questions between in-person appointments.`,

    'la-gateway': `${cityName} keratoconus patients who choose our practice gain access to scleral lens fitting expertise that most large LA ophthalmology practices do not prioritize. Scleral lenses require a different skill set than cataract surgery or LASIK—the fitting is iterative, precision-dependent, and demands a deep understanding of corneal topography in diseased eyes. Dr. Bonakdar's 500+ keratoconus cases have built pattern recognition that no amount of textbook knowledge can replace. For ${cityName} residents, the practical benefits of scleral lenses include elimination of the halos and ghosting that make LA freeway driving dangerous, all-day comfort in air-conditioned office environments, and vision quality that supports every professional demand from reading fine print to presenting in boardrooms. The lenses are custom-manufactured to your corneal topography, meaning the correction addresses your specific pattern of keratoconus—not a generic lens curve. Our location in central Orange County is accessible from ${cityName} via multiple freeways, typically a shorter drive than crossing LA to reach a Westside specialist.`,

export function getPrevalenceContext(cityType: CityType, cityName: string): string {
  const prevalence: Record<CityType, string> = {
    'coastal-affluent': `Keratoconus affects approximately 1 in 375 people globally, though prevalence varies significantly by ethnicity and environment. In ${cityName}'s demographic profile, the condition is commonly identified during young adulthood when patients seek correction for what appears to be worsening astigmatism. Coastal environmental factors may contribute to earlier symptom awareness, as the high-glare conditions along ${cityName}'s shoreline make even mild keratoconus symptoms noticeable sooner than they might be in less visually demanding environments.`,

    'coastal-active': `Current research estimates keratoconus prevalence at roughly 1 in 375 individuals, making it far more common than many patients realize. In ${cityName}'s active population, the condition is often identified when athletic vision demands expose symptoms that desk-based patients might tolerate longer. Studies also suggest that chronic UV exposure and habitual eye rubbing—both prevalent in beach-lifestyle communities like ${cityName}—may accelerate progression in genetically predisposed individuals.`,

    'tech-university': `Keratoconus typically manifests between ages 15 and 25, making ${cityName}'s university and early-career population a high-risk demographic by age alone. Global prevalence is approximately 1 in 375, but screening studies using modern topography suggest the true number may be higher—many mild cases go undetected. In ${cityName}'s screen-intensive environment, patients often present when fluctuating prescriptions fail to provide stable vision for sustained digital work.`,

    'family-suburban': `Keratoconus is the most common corneal dystrophy, affecting roughly 1 in 375 people, with onset almost always occurring between ages 10 and 25. For ${cityName} families, this means children and teenagers represent the highest-risk group. The condition has a genetic component: a child with one affected parent has approximately a 1 in 10 chance of developing keratoconus. With proper screening, early intervention through cross-linking can halt progression before significant vision loss occurs.`,

    'affluent-residential': `Modern corneal topography screening reveals keratoconus at a higher rate than previously estimated—approximately 1 in 375 people, with many mild cases historically attributed to simple astigmatism. In ${cityName}'s health-aware population, proactive screening identifies the condition earlier, enabling intervention before progression reaches advanced stages. Family screening is particularly valuable: when one family member is diagnosed, topographic evaluation of siblings and children can detect subclinical disease.`,

    'urban-diverse': `Keratoconus prevalence varies dramatically by ethnicity: studies show rates of 1 in 200 to 1 in 100 in Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and South Asian populations—2 to 4 times higher than in Caucasian populations. Given ${cityName}'s demographic composition, keratoconus is likely more prevalent here than county averages suggest. Unfortunately, limited access to corneal topography screening in underserved communities means many ${cityName} residents are diagnosed only after significant progression. Early screening changes outcomes.`,

    'suburban-commuter': `Keratoconus affects approximately 1 in 375 people, but many cases are initially misdiagnosed as ordinary astigmatism. For ${cityName} residents, the condition often becomes apparent through driving difficulties—halos around headlights and poor contrast in low-light conditions that progressively worsen despite new glasses prescriptions. If your optometrist has changed your astigmatism prescription three or more times in five years, corneal topography screening is warranted to rule out keratoconus.`,

    'inland-growing': `With an estimated prevalence of 1 in 375 people, keratoconus is far more common than most ${cityName} residents realize. In rapidly growing Inland communities, the combination of a younger median population (peak keratoconus onset ages) and limited local specialty care means cases are often diagnosed later than in areas with more corneal specialists. Late diagnosis allows unnecessary progression. If you have been told you have irregular astigmatism that glasses cannot fully correct, keratoconus should be investigated.`,

    'north-county-sd': `Keratoconus prevalence in San Diego County mirrors national estimates of approximately 1 in 375, with higher rates in the region's diverse population. For ${cityName} patients, the challenge is not diagnosis but access to specialized treatment. While San Diego has excellent general ophthalmology, dedicated keratoconus scleral lens fitting requires a specific case volume that few practices in the county maintain. Traveling to a high-volume specialist significantly improves the likelihood of achieving optimal vision correction.`,

    'la-gateway': `In the Los Angeles metro area, keratoconus is more common than many patients expect—roughly 1 in 375 people, with higher prevalence in the region's substantial Hispanic, Middle Eastern, and South Asian communities. ${cityName}'s population includes demographics where keratoconus may be 2-4 times more common than average. Despite LA's abundance of eye care providers, very few specialize in the advanced scleral lens fitting that keratoconus patients need for optimal vision restoration.`,
