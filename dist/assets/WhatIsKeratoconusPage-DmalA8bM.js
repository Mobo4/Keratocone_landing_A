          <p class="text-lg text-blue-800 leading-relaxed">
            Keratoconus is a progressive eye condition where the cornea (the clear, front surface of the eye) 
            gradually thins and bulges outward into a cone-like shape. This irregular shape distorts vision, 
            causing blurred and distorted images, increased sensitivity to light, and difficulty with night vision.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Keratoconus: A Comprehensive Overview</h2>
        <p>
          Keratoconus affects approximately 1 in 2,000 people, making it the most common corneal ectasia 
          (abnormal bulging) condition. As Orange County's leading keratoconus specialist, Dr. Alexander 
          Bonakdar has diagnosed and treated over 1,200 patients with this condition at Eyecare Center 
          of Orange County.
        </p>

        <h3>How Keratoconus Affects Your Vision</h3>
        <p>
          In a healthy eye, the cornea maintains a smooth, dome-like shape that helps focus light properly 
          onto the retina. With keratoconus, the cornea becomes progressively thinner and weaker, causing 
          it to bulge forward in an irregular cone shape. This distortion prevents light from focusing 
          correctly, resulting in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Blurred and distorted vision</li>
          <li>Increased astigmatism</li>
          <li>Light sensitivity (photophobia)</li>
          <li>Glare and halos around lights</li>
          <li>Frequent prescription changes</li>
          <li>Difficulty driving at night</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Who Gets Keratoconus?</h3>
        <p>
          Keratoconus typically develops during the teenage years and early twenties, though it can 
          occasionally appear later in life. The condition affects both eyes, though often to different 
          degrees. Research shows several factors may increase the risk of developing keratoconus:
        </p>

        <h4>Genetic Factors</h4>
        <p>
          Family history plays a significant role, with about 10% of keratoconus patients having a 
          relative with the condition. If you have a family history of keratoconus, regular eye 
          exams are crucial for early detection.
        </p>

        <h4>Environmental and Behavioral Factors</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Eye rubbing:</strong> Chronic, vigorous eye rubbing is strongly associated with keratoconus development</li>
          <li><strong>Allergic conditions:</strong> Patients with allergic conjunctivitis, asthma, or eczema have higher rates</li>
          <li><strong>Contact lens wear:</strong> Poor fitting contact lenses may contribute to corneal stress</li>
          <li><strong>UV exposure:</strong> Excessive sun exposure without protection may be a factor</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Stages of Keratoconus Progression</h3>
        <p>
          Understanding the progression stages helps patients and doctors make informed treatment decisions:
        </p>

        <h4>Stage 1: Early Keratoconus</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Minimal corneal thinning</li>
          <li>Slight irregular astigmatism</li>
          <li>Vision correctable with glasses or soft contact lenses</li>
          <li>May be detected only through corneal topography</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stage 2: Moderate Keratoconus</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Increased corneal steepening</li>
          <li>More significant astigmatism</li>
          <li>Glasses become less effective</li>
          <li>Specialty contact lenses often needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stage 3: Advanced Keratoconus</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Severe corneal thinning and steepening</li>
          <li>Significant visual impairment</li>
          <li>Difficult to fit with contact lenses</li>
          <li>May require surgical intervention</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Stage 4: Severe Keratoconus</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Extreme corneal distortion</li>
          <li>Risk of corneal scarring</li>
          <li>Contact lens intolerance</li>
          <li>Corneal transplant may be necessary</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Modern Diagnostic Techniques</h3>
        <p>
          At Eyecare Center of Orange County, Dr. Bonakdar uses advanced diagnostic technology to 
          detect keratoconus in its earliest stages:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Corneal Topography:</strong> Creates detailed maps of corneal curvature</li>
          <li><strong>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):</strong> Measures corneal thickness precisely</li>
          <li><strong>Pentacam Analysis:</strong> Provides comprehensive anterior segment imaging</li>
          <li><strong>Wavefront Analysis:</strong> Detects subtle optical aberrations</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Treatment Options: From Conservative to Surgical</h3>
        <p>
          Treatment for keratoconus depends on the stage and progression rate. Dr. Bonakdar's 
          comprehensive approach includes:
        </p>

        <h4>Non-Surgical Treatments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Specialty Contact Lenses:</strong> RGP, hybrid, and scleral lenses</li>
          <li><strong>Custom Soft Lenses:</strong> For mild cases</li>
          <li><strong>Intacs:</strong> Corneal ring segments to reshape the cornea</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Surgical Treatments</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Corneal Cross-Linking:</strong> Strengthens corneal tissue to halt progression</li>
          <li><strong>PRK with Cross-Linking:</strong> Combined approach for vision correction</li>
          <li><strong>Corneal Transplant:</strong> For advanced cases unresponsive to other treatments</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Living with Keratoconus: What to Expect</h3>
        <p>
          While keratoconus is a serious condition, most patients can maintain good quality of life 
          with proper management. Dr. Bonakdar emphasizes the importance of:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Regular monitoring to track progression</li>
          <li>Avoiding eye rubbing at all costs</li>
          <li>Wearing UV protection outdoors</li>
          <li>Managing allergies effectively</li>
          <li>Following contact lens care instructions precisely</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Importance of Early Detection</h3>
        <p>
          Early detection of keratoconus is crucial for preserving vision and slowing progression. 
          Dr. Bonakdar recommends annual eye exams for everyone, with more frequent monitoring for 
          those at higher risk.
