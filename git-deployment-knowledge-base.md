## Recent Deployment Process (July 9, 2025)

### Actions Performed

1. **Updated `.gitignore` File**
   - Added environment files (`.env`, `.env.local`, `.env.development`, `.env.production`) to prevent committing sensitive information
   - This helps maintain security best practices by keeping configuration variables private

2. **Committed Feature Branch Changes**
   - Committed pending changes to the `feature/seo-improvements` branch
   - Files updated: `.gitignore`, `package-lock.json`, `package.json`, `src/pages/KeratoconusLandingPage.tsx`
   - Commit message: "Update .gitignore to exclude environment files and update packages and Keratoconus landing page"

3. **Pushed Feature Branch**
   - Pushed the updated `feature/seo-improvements` branch to the remote repository

4. **Merged to Main Branch**
   - Switched to the `main` branch
   - Merged the `feature/seo-improvements` branch into `main` (fast-forward merge)
   - The merge included 29 files with 2,654 insertions and 530 deletions

5. **Pushed Main Branch**
   - Pushed the updated `main` branch to the remote repository
   - This triggers the deployment process for the website

## Deployment Configuration

The website is **not configured for automatic deployment** from the GitHub repository. Instead, it uses the Lovable platform for deployment.

**Deployment Process:**
1. Code changes are pushed to the GitHub repository (as we've done)
2. To publish these changes, you need to:
   - Open the [Lovable platform](https://lovable.dev/projects/0e992bde-ccf7-4773-9b61-80337177177b)
   - Click on "Share" -> "Publish"

This means that even though we've pushed our changes to the `main` branch, an additional manual step is required to make these changes live on the website.

## Future Development Guidelines

1. **Feature Development Workflow**
   - Create a new feature branch from `main` for each new feature or improvement
   - Develop and test the feature on the feature branch
   - When ready, merge the feature branch into `main` to deploy

2. **Environment Variables**
   - Keep all sensitive information in environment variables
   - Use `.env.example` as a template for required environment variables
   - Never commit actual `.env` files to the repository

3. **Documentation**
   - Keep documentation updated with new features and improvements
   - Update this knowledge base document with any changes to the deployment process

## Troubleshooting

If the website does not update after pushing to `main`:

1. Check the deployment logs in your hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.)
2. Verify that the `main` branch was properly pushed (`git log --oneline origin/main`)
3. Ensure all necessary build dependencies are properly configured
