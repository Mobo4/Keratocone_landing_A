            "p1": "For over 35 years, Dr. Bonakdar has dedicated his practice as a keratoconus specialist to the \"impossible\" cases. While many eye doctors shy away from complex keratoconus cases, this keratoconus doctor runs toward them.",

            "description": "Many of our keratoconus patients have been to multiple eye doctors before finding our keratoconus specialist. They've been told their corneas are \"too irregular,\" that they need a transplant, or that \"nothing more can be done.\" Dr. Bonakdar, as a keratoconus specialist, excels in these exact cases. His expertise in advanced scleral lens designs for keratoconus treatment, combined with cutting-edge topography mapping, allows him to achieve successful fits in situations where other keratoconus doctors have failed. Patients from across California—and even out of state—seek his keratoconus treatment because they know that if there's a non-surgical solution, this keratoconus specialist will find it."
