          <p class="text-lg text-blue-800 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Eyes can be chronically dry due to several factors:
          </p>
          <ul class="text-blue-800 space-y-2">
            <li>• Decreased tear production due to aging or medical conditions</li>
            <li>• Poor tear quality from meibomian gland dysfunction</li>
            <li>• Environmental factors like dry air or wind</li>
            <li>• Digital device use reducing blink rate</li>
            <li>• Medications that reduce tear production</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <h2>Understanding Chronic Dry Eyes: More Common Than You Think</h2>
        <p>
          If you constantly ask yourself "Why are my eyes always dry?", you're not alone. Dry eye 
          syndrome affects over 30% of adults, with rates increasing due to digital device use, 
          environmental factors, and aging populations. Dr. Alexander Bonakdar has treated thousands 
          of dry eye patients at Eyecare Center of Orange County, helping them find lasting relief.
        </p>

        <h3>The Science Behind Tear Production</h3>
        <p>
          To understand why your eyes are always dry, it's essential to know how healthy tears work. 
          Tears aren't just water – they're a complex mixture of three layers:
        </p>

        <h4>The Three Layers of Tears</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Mucin Layer (Inner):</strong> Helps tears stick to the eye surface</li>
          <li><strong>Aqueous Layer (Middle):</strong> Provides hydration and nutrients</li>
          <li><strong>Lipid Layer (Outer):</strong> Prevents tears from evaporating too quickly</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          When any of these layers is disrupted, you experience dry eye symptoms. Understanding 
          which layer is affected helps Dr. Bonakdar create targeted treatment plans.
        </p>

        <h3>Primary Causes of Chronic Dry Eyes</h3>
        
        <h4>1. Age-Related Changes</h4>
        <p>
          As we age, our bodies naturally produce fewer tears. This is particularly common in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Women over 50 (due to hormonal changes)</li>
          <li>Men over 60</li>
          <li>Post-menopausal women</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Dr. Bonakdar notes that while aging is unavoidable, age-related dry eyes can be 
          effectively managed with proper treatment.
        </p>

        <h4>2. Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD)</h4>
        <p>
          This is the leading cause of dry eyes, affecting up to 85% of dry eye patients. 
          The meibomian glands in your eyelids produce the oil layer of tears. When these 
          glands become blocked or produce poor-quality oil, tears evaporate too quickly.
        </p>

        <h5>Signs of MGD:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Eyes feel dry within hours of waking</li>
          <li>Burning sensation, especially in the evening</li>
          <li>Fluctuating vision that improves with blinking</li>
          <li>Feeling like something is stuck in your eye</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Digital Device Use (Computer Vision Syndrome)</h4>
        <p>
          Staring at screens reduces your blink rate by up to 60%, leading to increased tear 
          evaporation. With remote work becoming more common, Dr. Bonakdar has seen a significant 
          increase in digital eye strain and associated dry eyes.
        </p>

        <h5>Screen-Related Dry Eye Factors:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced blink rate and incomplete blinks</li>
          <li>Blue light exposure</li>
          <li>Poor screen positioning</li>
          <li>Extended screen time without breaks</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>4. Environmental Factors</h4>
        <p>
          Your environment plays a huge role in eye comfort. Common environmental triggers include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Low humidity:</strong> Air conditioning, heating systems, airplane cabins</li>
          <li><strong>Wind exposure:</strong> Fans, car vents, outdoor activities</li>
          <li><strong>Air pollution:</strong> Smoke, dust, chemical fumes</li>
          <li><strong>High altitude:</strong> Lower humidity at elevation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>5. Medications That Cause Dry Eyes</h4>
        <p>
          Many common medications reduce tear production as a side effect:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Antihistamines:</strong> Allergy medications</li>
          <li><strong>Antidepressants:</strong> Particularly tricyclics and SSRIs</li>
          <li><strong>Blood pressure medications:</strong> Beta-blockers and diuretics</li>
          <li><strong>Birth control pills:</strong> Hormonal contraceptives</li>
          <li><strong>Pain relievers:</strong> NSAIDs and some prescription pain medications</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          <em>Note: Never stop prescribed medications without consulting your doctor. Dr. Bonakdar 
          can help manage dry eyes while you continue necessary treatments.</em>
        </p>

        <h4>6. Medical Conditions Linked to Dry Eyes</h4>
        <p>
          Certain health conditions frequently cause or worsen dry eyes:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Autoimmune conditions:</strong> Sjögren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus</li>
          <li><strong>Thyroid disorders:</strong> Both hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism</li>
          <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Can affect tear production and quality</li>
          <li><strong>Rosacea:</strong> Often includes ocular rosacea affecting the eyes</li>
          <li><strong>Blepharitis:</strong> Chronic eyelid inflammation</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>7. Contact Lens-Related Dry Eyes</h4>
        <p>
          Contact lenses can contribute to dry eyes through:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Absorbing tears from the eye surface</li>
          <li>Disrupting the natural tear film</li>
          <li>Accumulating protein deposits that irritate eyes</li>
          <li>Poor lens fit or material compatibility</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Symptoms That Indicate Chronic Dry Eyes</h3>
        <p>
          Beyond the obvious feeling of dryness, chronic dry eyes can cause:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Burning or stinging sensation</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Gritty feeling,</strong> like sand in your eyes</li>
          <li><strong>Excessive tearing</strong> (reflex tearing from irritation)</li>
          <li><strong>Blurred vision</strong> that clears with blinking</li>
          <li><strong>Light sensitivity</strong> (photophobia)</li>
          <li><strong>Eye fatigue,</strong> especially with reading or computer work</li>
          <li><strong>Difficulty wearing contact lenses</strong></li>
          <li><strong>Stringy mucus</strong> around the eyes</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Diagnostic Process: Getting to the Root Cause</h3>
        <p>
          When you visit Dr. Bonakdar with chronic dry eyes, he uses advanced diagnostic tools to 
          identify the specific cause:
        </p>

        <h4>Comprehensive Dry Eye Evaluation</h4>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Schirmer Test:</strong> Measures tear production quantity</li>
          <li><strong>Tear Break-Up Time:</strong> Assesses tear film stability</li>
          <li><strong>Meibography:</strong> Images meibomian glands to check for blockages</li>
          <li><strong>Osmolarity Testing:</strong> Measures tear film salt concentration</li>
          <li><strong>Inflammatory Markers:</strong> Checks for elevated inflammation levels</li>
        </ul>

        question: 'What are the main symptoms of chronic dry eyes?',
        answer: 'Common chronic dry eye symptoms include burning, stinging, scratchy feeling, gritty sensation like sand in your eyes, excessive tearing (reflex tearing), blurred vision that improves with blinking, light sensitivity, eye fatigue, and difficulty wearing contact lenses.',

      },
      {
        question: 'Why do my eyes feel dry even when they\'re watering?',
        answer: 'This is called reflex tearing. When your eyes are dry and irritated, they produce excess tears as a protective response. However, these reflex tears are poor quality and don\'t provide the proper lubrication your eyes need, so the dryness sensation persists.',

        question: 'Do computer screens really make dry eyes worse?',
        answer: 'Yes, computer screens significantly contribute to dry eyes. When focusing on screens, people blink 60% less frequently and often have incomplete blinks. This reduces tear distribution and increases evaporation, leading to digital eye strain and dry eye symptoms.',
