## Detailed SEO Analysis

### SEO Score Breakdown by Criteria

| Criterion | Weight | Pass Rate | Critical Issues |
|-----------|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| Page Title | 20% | ~60% | Several pages missing titles entirely |
| Meta Description | 20% | ~60% | Many descriptions missing or too long |
| Canonical URL | 15% | ~75% | Some pages lack canonical URLs |
| Structured Data | 20% | ~75% | Medical schema implementation varies |
| H1 Tags | 10% | ~5% | **Critical:** Most pages missing H1 tags |
| Heading Hierarchy | 5% | ~90% | Generally well-structured |
| Image Alt Text | 5% | ~80% | Most images have alt text |
| Internal Links | 5% | ~60% | Some pages lack internal linking |

### Critical Issues Found

#### 1. H1 Tag Crisis (Priority: URGENT)
- **75 out of 76 pages** are missing H1 tags
- This is a fundamental SEO requirement
- Search engines use H1 tags to understand page topics
- **Immediate action required**

#### 2. SEO Component Implementation Inconsistency
- Some pages missing complete SEO component implementation
- Example: `ChalazionStyePage.tsx` missing all SEO elements:
  - No page title
  - No meta description  
  - No canonical URL
  - No structured data

#### 3. Meta Tag Optimization Needed
- Several pages have titles > 60 characters (too long)
- Meta descriptions > 160 characters in some cases
- Missing keywords on many pages

### Pages With Strong SEO Implementation

Only **1 page** (`CataractsEducationPage.tsx`) meets the 80% threshold with:
- ✅ Proper SEO component implementation
- ✅ Structured data (MedicalCondition schema)
- ✅ Title: "Cataracts: Symptoms, Causes, and Treatment | Patient Education"
- ✅ Meta description within optimal length
- ✅ Canonical URL properly set
- ❌ Missing H1 tag (even this good example has the H1 issue)

## Conclusion

The bonakdar_net_Lovable project has **excellent SEO infrastructure** with a robust SEO component and comprehensive schema markup generator. However, **implementation inconsistencies** have resulted in a low average SEO score of 38.5%.

The primary issue is the **missing H1 tags on 98% of pages**, which is easily fixable but critical for search engine optimization. With focused effort on the urgent and high-priority recommendations, this site can achieve a 75-95% SEO score and significantly improve its search engine visibility for eye care conditions in Orange County.

**Next Steps:**
1. Implement H1 tags immediately (can be done in 1-2 days)
2. Fix SEO component implementation (1 week)
3. Create missing condition pages (2-3 weeks)
4. Monitor and optimize based on generated reports

The tools created during this audit can be run regularly to maintain SEO quality and catch issues early in the development process.
